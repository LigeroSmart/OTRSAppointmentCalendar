    <section>
        <title>Management of multiple calendars</title>
        <para>
            Via a management interface it is possible to add and edit calendars.
        </para>
        <para>
            Beside calendar names, it is possible to assign colors and access groups, as well as the current validity of the calendars.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Exports and imports</title>
        <para>
            Once different calendars are create, it is possible to export either the complete calendar definition (including the calendar appointments)
            in the well-known YAML-Format or just export the related appointments of a calendar to ICS-Format.
        </para>
        <para>
            It is also possible to import complete calendar structures using previously exported YAML files to restore calendar definitions or import
            just calendar appointments to an existing calendar using ICS file uploads.
        </para>
        <para>
            That offers the possibility to backup and restore single calendars or transfer them to a different OTRS installation or an external calendar tool.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Management of calendar appointments</title>
        <para>
            If at least one calendar is created and accessible by a certain agent, new or already existing appointments can be managed via a calendar overview and
            an agenda overview.
        </para>
        <para>
            Within the calendar overview, an agent is able to display, create, edit and/or delete appointments of different calendars, depending on his permission
            to the related calendars. Such appointments can be created or edited via drag and drop within this screen.
        </para>
        <para>
            The visibility of single calendars can be enabled or disabled through a calendar list within the screen.
        </para>
        <para>
            To have a good overview of available appointments within different calendars and the related dates they start or end, it is possible to select different
            view modes, like weekly view, monthly view, different timeline related views etc.
        </para>
        <para>
            Within the agenda overview, an agent is able to display the appointments of all available (accessible) calendars in a table like overview. This overview
            is designed to have a detailed overview of upcoming appointments in a structured table. Like in the calendar overview appointments can be created, edited
            or deleted. This view supports a monthly, weekly and daily point of view on available appointments.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Repeating appointments</title>
        <para>

        </para>
        <para>
            Beside pre-defined frequencies like daily, weekly, monthly etc. it is possible to setup custom repeats and exclude weekdays or dates of months,
            define the amount of recurrences and/or the end date after the appointment stops to repeat.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Notifications</title>
        <para>
            Within the edit screen of an appointment, it is possible to setup a date to notify about the appointment.
        </para>
        <para>
            As in the settings for appointment repeat, it is possible to use pre-defined templates for notifications (i.e. 5 minutes before, 15 minutes before etc.)
            or setup a custom point of time.
        </para>
        <para>
            The custom settings for notifications allows to setup a relative point of time (like 5 minutes after the appointment has been started.) or an explicit
            datetime expression.
        </para>
    </section>

        <title>Management of multiple calendars</title>
        <para>
            Via a management interface it is possible to add and edit calendars.

            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%" fileref="images/CalendarManage-Overview.png" format="PNG"/>
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
        </para>
        <para>
            If a new calendar needs to be created or edited, it's necessary to define a calendar name a color and the permission group, the calendar
            belongs to. This is needed for agents to access the calendar properly with the related permissions.

            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%" fileref="images/CalendarManage-CalendarEdit.png" format="PNG"/>
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>

            The color can be selected with the built-in colorpicker, like in the following screenshot. There are three ways to select a color with the
            colorpicker. After clicking on the preselected color, a windows opens with a set of pre-defined colors ready to be used. If your preferred
            color is not available, you can click on the button "More", to open the advanced mode.

            <mediaobject>

                    <imagedata scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%" fileref="images/CalendarManage-CalendarEdit-Colorpicker.png" format="PNG"/>
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>

            Within that mode, you can either select a certain color by using the color bar and the color field with your mouse or you're able to directly
            use a hexcode of a desired color. By clicking on the button "Less", you can shrink the colorpicker back again to the standard mode.
            Right after a click on the button "Confirm", the new color is selected and visible in the preview field. Even if you selected a certain color
            within the advanced, the previous color will be selected again (and visible in the preview field), if you click on the "Cancel" button, but this
            just works, if you didn't confirmed your selection yet. If that's the case (but you did not save the calender yet), you may just reload your
            screen and see you current color setting again.

        <para>
            For the selected permission group of your calendar, an agent who should have access to, needs at least a read-permission within the related group.
            Enclosed a list of permissions to access certain feature-levels within the different calendars:

            <itemizedlist mark="round">
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        RO: The related agent can see the calendar and it's appointments, but can't do any changes.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        MOVE_INTO: The related agent can update existing appointments, but can't create new ones or delete existing ones.
                    </para>

        </para>
        <para>
            The validity field indicates, if a calendar is valid. Invalid calendars won't show up in the different views, even if agents have access to it.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Exports and imports</title>
        <para>
            Once different calendars are create, it is possible to export either the complete calendar definition (including the calendar appointments)
            in the well-known YAML-Format or just export the related appointments of a calendar to ICS-Format.
        </para>
        <para>
            It is also possible to import complete calendar structures using previously exported YAML files to restore calendar definitions or import
            just calendar appointments to an existing calendar using ICS file uploads.
        </para>
        <para>
            That offers the possibility to backup and restore single calendars or transfer them to a different OTRS installation or an external calendar tool.

        <para>
            Within the calendar overview, an agent is able to display, create, edit and/or delete appointments of different calendars, depending on his permission
            to the related calendars. Such appointments can be created or edited via drag and drop within this screen.
        </para>
        <para>
            The visibility of single calendars can be enabled or disabled through a calendar list within the screen.
        </para>
        <para>
            To have a good overview of available appointments within different calendars and the related dates they start or end, it is possible to select different
            view modes, like weekly view, monthly view, different timeline related views etc.
        </para>
        <para>
            Within the agenda overview, an agent is able to display the appointments of all available (accessible) calendars in a table like overview. This overview
            is designed to have a detailed overview of upcoming appointments in a structured table. Like in the calendar overview appointments can be created, edited
            or deleted. This view supports a monthly, weekly and daily point of view on available appointments.

        <para>
            As in the settings for appointment repeat, it is possible to use pre-defined templates for notifications (i.e. 5 minutes before, 15 minutes before etc.)
            or setup a custom point of time.
        </para>
        <para>
            The custom settings for notifications allows to setup a relative point of time (like 5 minutes after the appointment has been started.) or an explicit
            datetime expression.
