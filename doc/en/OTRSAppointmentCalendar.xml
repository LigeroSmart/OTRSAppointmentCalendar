    <section>
        <title>Management of multiple calendars</title>
        <para>
            Via a management interface it is possible to add and edit calendars.
        </para>
        <para>
            Beside calendar names, it is possible to assign colors and access groups, as well as the current validity of the calendars.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Exports and imports</title>
        <para>
            Once different calendars are created, it is possible to export either the complete calendar definition (including the calendar appointments)
            in the well-known YAML-Format or just export the related appointments of a calendar to ICS-Format.
        </para>
        <para>
            It is also possible to import complete calendar structures using previously exported YAML files to restore calendar definitions or import
            just calendar appointments to an existing calendar using ICS file uploads.
        </para>
        <para>
            That offers the possibility to backup and restore single calendars or transfer them to a different OTRS installation or an external calendar tool.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Management of calendar appointments</title>
        <para>
            If at least one calendar is created and accessible by a certain agent, new or already existing appointments can be managed via a calendar overview and
            an agenda overview.
        </para>
        <para>
            Within the calendar overview, an agent is able to display, create, edit and/or delete appointments of different calendars, depending on their permission
            level to the related calendars. Such appointments can be created or edited via drag and drop within this screen.
        </para>
        <para>
            The visibility of single calendars can be enabled or disabled through the calendar list within the screen.
        </para>
        <para>
            To have a good overview of available appointments within different calendars and the related dates they start or end, it is possible to select different
            view modes, like weekly view, monthly view, different timeline related views etc.
        </para>
        <para>
            Within the agenda overview, an agent is able to display the appointments of all available (accessible) calendars in a table-like overview. This overview
            is designed to have a detailed overview of upcoming appointments in a structured table. Like in the calendar overview, appointments can be created, edited
            or deleted. This view supports a monthly, weekly and daily point of view on available appointments.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Repeating appointments</title>
        <para>
            If recurring appointments needs to be archived, it is possible to setup detailed information about the occurrences of a single appointment.
        </para>
        <para>
            Beside pre-defined frequencies like daily, weekly, monthly etc. it is possible to setup custom repeats and exclude weekdays or dates of months,
            define the amount of recurrences and/or the end date after the appointment stops to repeat.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Notifications</title>
        <para>
            Within the edit screen of an appointment, it is possible to setup a date to notify about the appointment.
        </para>
        <para>
            As in the settings for appointment repeat, it is possible to use pre-defined templates for notifications (i.e. 5 minutes before, 15 minutes before etc.)
            or setup a custom point of time.
        </para>
        <para>
            The custom settings for notifications allows to setup a relative point of time (like 5 minutes after the appointment has been started.) or an explicit
            date/time expression.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Link tickets to appointments</title>

        </para>
        <para>
            Those links can either be created through an existing appointment, using the overviews or via the link feature in the ticket zoom.
        </para>
        <para>
            It's also possible to create a new appointment out of the ticket zoom, which links the related ticket automatically to the new appointment.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Dashboard-Widget for upcoming appointments</title>
        <para>

            The color can be selected with the built-in color picker, like in the following screenshot. There are three ways to select a color with the
            color picker. After clicking on the preselected color, a windows opens with a set of pre-defined colors ready to be used. If your preferred
            color is not available, you can click on the button &quot;More&quot;, to open the advanced mode.

            Within that mode, you can either select a certain color by using the color bar and the color field with your mouse or you're able to directly
            use a hexadecimal code of a desired color. By clicking on the button &quot;Less&quot;, you can shrink the colorpicker back again to the standard mode.
            Right after a click on the button &quot;Confirm&quot;, the new color is selected and visible in the preview field. Even if you selected a certain color
            within the advanced, the previous color will be selected again (and visible in the preview field) if you click on the &quot;Cancel&quot; button, but this
            just works if you didn't confirmed your selection yet. If that's the case (but you did not save the calendar yet), you may just reload your
            screen and see you current color setting again.

            For the selected permission group of your calendar, an agent who should have access to, needs at least a read permission within the related group.

        <title>Exporting calendars and/or appointments</title>
        <para>
            Once different calendars are created, it's possible to export either the complete calendar definition (including the calendar appointments)
            in the well-known YAML-Format or just export the related appointments of a calendar to ICS-Format.
        </para>
        <para>
            To export a complete calendar structure to the YAML-Format, the calendar list in the calendar management screen can be used.
            By clicking on the related link within column &quot;Export&quot;, a YAML structure named &quot;Export_Calendar_CalendarName.yml&quot;, including the calendar meta-data
            (calendar name, color, permission group, validity state) can be downloaded. The structure also includes all calendar appointments. This functionality
            can be used to simply backup a certain calendar and/or transfer it to a foreign OTRS instance.
        </para>
        <para>
            To export just the calendar appointments in ICS-Format, the link within column &quot;Download&quot; can be used. After clicking on the related link, an ICS-File
            named &quot;CalendarName.ics&quot; can be downloaded, including all appointments of the related calendar. This file can be used to backup just the appointments
            of a certain calendar and/or transfer it to either an existing calendar on a foreign OTRS instance or any other calendar tool, which supports the
            ICS-Standard, to display the appointments.

        <title>Importing calendars and/or appointments</title>

            As an equivalent to the export function, it is possible to either import a complete calendar structure including related appointments in the YAML-Format,
            or just a set of appointments to an already existing calendar in the ICS-Format.
        </para>
        <para>
            To import a complete calendar structure, the related widget &quot;Calendar Import&quot; on the left side of the calendar management screen can be used. Within this
            widget, a YML-File can be selected and uploaded to import the calendar. The checkbox &quot;Overwrite existing entities&quot; indicates if a calendar with the same
            name as the imported one should be overwritten. If a calendar with the same name exists, but the checkbox is empty during the upload, a related error
            message will be displayed.
        </para>
        <para>
            To import a set of appointments to an already existing calendar, the button &quot;Import Appointments&quot; can be clicked to access the appointment import screen.

        <para>
            Here it's needed to select an ICS-File to be used for the import. Right after that, a calendar needs to be selected from the related list to import the
            new appointments in. The checkbox &quot;Update existing appointments&quot; indicates, if already existing appointments with the same UniqueID shall be overwritten
            or not. Appointments with the same UniqueID but already existing in the related calendar won't be omitted during the import process. They will be inserted
            again and will be available multiple times in case of doubt, if the option to overwrite appointments is not enabled.

            the agenda overview.
        </para>
        <para>
            Within the calendar overview, an agent is able to display, create, edit and/or delete appointments of different calendars, depending on their permission
            level to the related calendars, as described above.

            As visible in the following screenshot, the calendar overview contains the management tools for the calendars and appointments on the left side and the
            calendar view on the right side.
            With the buttons in the Actions-Widget it's possible to either access the calendar management directly or add a new appointment (if the agent has the
            permission).

        <para>
            The widget &quot;Calendars&quot; contains all calendars accessible by the agent. The checkboxes are used to enable or disable the view of certain calendars, like
            it's the case in many foreign calendar tools.
        </para>
        <para>
            Since all appointments of any active calendar for every agent will be provided by the server (and not stored or cached on the client), it can result in
            heavy load on the server if too many calendars are active at the same time. Therefore a SysConfig option &quot;AppointmentCalendar::CalendarLimitOverview&quot;
            limits the maximum number of active calendars per agent. If the limit is reached by an agent, a related error message will be displayed, indicating the
            there are too many active calendars.

            The information in the middle of the top-bar shows the current time range the agent is in, for the current view. Within the timeline views, the current

            If the update affects all appointments, the behavior will be the same as with the update of the parent appointment. All options (including the recurring
            settings) are changeable.

        <para>
            If just the current (child) occurrence is affected, it's not possible to change the repeat-settings, but a related message and a link to the parent

        <title>Notifications</title>
        <para>
            Within the edit screen of an appointment, it is possible to setup a date to notify about the appointment.
            As in the settings for appointment repeat, it is possible to use pre-defined templates for notifications (i.e. 5 minutes before, 15 minutes before etc.)
            or to setup a custom point of time:
        </para>
        <para>

            </mediaobject>
        </para>
        <para>
            The custom settings for notifications are split into a relative point of time (like 5 minutes after the appointment has been started, 2 hours before
            the appointment ends etc.) and an explicit date time value, which can additionally be selected with a date picker. The related section needs to be
            enabled with a radio button, hence the disabled section will be ignored.
        </para>
        <para>
            If an appointment has an active notification setting, the date/time string of the notification will be displayed in the tooltip.
            In addition to that, the appointment will be marked with a bell-symbol to indicate that there is an active notification set, without any mouse over
            actions.

        <title>Link tickets to appointments</title>
        <para>
            The appointment calendar comes with an abstraction layer to link external objects with appointments, using the OTRS internal link object.
            Those additional objects can come up with external packages without any further need to update the code of the calendar directly.
        </para>
        <para>
            Basically within the edit screen of an appointment, it is possible to link existing tickets. Tickets can be searched by their ticket numbers
            and/or ticket titles via an autocompletion field. Once the agent clicks on a result, the related ticket will be saved in a result box and
            after the appointment has been saved, the ticket will be linked to the appointment.
        </para>

        </para>
        <para>
            Additionally it's possible to link multiple tickets to one appointment. Since the normal OTRS link object is used to create the connection
            between both objects, the link will be displayed in the ticket zoom screen as well.

        <para>
            Those links can either be created through an existing appointment in the related edit dialog, using the overviews or via the link feature
            in the ticket zoom.

            Via the ticket zoom screen, it's additionally possible to create a new appointment, which links the related ticket automatically to
            the newly created appointment. There is a new option &quot;New Appointment&quot; located in the ticket action menu &quot;Miscellaneous&quot;.
        </para>

        </para>
        <para>
            After a click on the link, the agent will be forwarded to the calendar overview, which automatically opens a new appointment dialog,
            that has the related ticket pre-linked and can be filled out as usual.

        <title>Managed ticket appointments</title>
        <para>
            To make a step back to the calendar management, the package offers the possibility to automatically create and update appointments in
            calendars, using a special ticket search method within the calendar edit screen.
            Tickets can have special date/time entries like pending times, escalation times (first response time, update time etc.) or assigned
            dynamic field from type date/time.
        </para>
        <para>
            Logically, the calendars are able to show those date/time entries, but since the calendar appointments needs to have time ranges consisting
            of a start time and an end time, it's needed to define a related end time for managed appointments, as times like the pending time points
            to just one date/time value.
        </para>
        <para>
            Below the normal calendar data in the calendar edit screen, a special widget called &quot;Ticket Appointments&quot; takes care about the rules to
            be used for automatic appointment creation.
        </para>
        <para>

        </para>
        <para>
            It's necessary to define rules to describe a ticket search for tickets, which will result in automatically created and managed appointments
            in the related calendar. It's possible to define multiple rules with different parameters to combine several types of tickets within
            the same calendar.
        </para>
        <para>
            A rule consists of the following parameters to generate proper ticket searches:

                    <para>
                        Start date: A dropdown list, that indicates the special date/time value of the related tickets. This can be either the pending time,
                        the different escalation times or a dynamic field from type date/time assigned to the ticket.
                    </para>

                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        End date: This can be a relative time value, counted from the selected start time (like +5 minutes, +1 hour etc.) or a dynamic field
                        from type date/time, pointing to an absolute date and time value.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Queues: A multi-selectable dropdown list, that indicates the queues the related tickets needs to be located in. This field is
                        mandatory and can't be left unfilled.

                        Search attributes: This is a list of additional (optional) search attributes to provide more detailed filter possibilities to the
                        agent. It acts like the search attributes in AgentTicketSearch. Single attributes can be selected, added to the form and filled out
                        with filter values.

        <para>
            The rule in the screenshot will find all tickets that have a pending time and would add one hour to the related pending time to generate
            the end time and create appointments for the set of found tickets during the search. The tickets additionally needs to be located in queue &quot;Raw&quot;.

        <para>
            The P-Symbol indicates that this appointment includes a pending time as the start time value. The end time value is a dynamic field from

            </mediaobject>
        </para>
        <para>
            The appointment title will be displayed as ticket number and title and cannot be changed, since it's automatically created, updated and removed,
            depending on the related ticket. Title will be displayed as a link to the related TicketZoom screen.
        </para>
        <para>
            Of course, it's still possible to define basic information like a description and a location, which will be stored for that single appointment.
            For such appointments it's also possible to define notification times and link additional tickets.
        </para>
        <para>
            Some of those start time values are variable and therefore updatable by the related agent and some are not.
        </para>
        <para>
            For instance the pending time is a value that can be changed using the pending ticket action in the ticket zoom of the related ticket. Dynamic field
            values can be changed easily, too.
        </para>
        <para>
            An escalation value like first response time or the update time are special values which will be computed using a Service / SLA entry assigned
            to the related ticket.
        </para>
        <para>
            If, for instance, an automatically created appointment of type pending time is changed using the calendar overview, the related value will be
            updated in the ticket as well, which is the same behavior as for special appointments of type dynamic field. Therefore it's either possible to update
            the related ticket using the ticket zoom, or by just updating the appointment that writes back all needed changes to the ticket.
        </para>
        <para>
            Appointments from type escalation time cannot be updated using the related appointments, as those values are not changeable directly by the agent.
            Such appointments are simply read-only on the related values, as well as on the drag and drop features/handles.
        </para>
        <para>
            On every update on the calendar definition or the related tickets, the automatically created appointments will be updated as well. This work
            will be done by the OTRS-Daemon in the background. Therefore, it's necessary to have the daemon running for this feature to work properly!

        <para>
            It offers the possibility to create new appointments with a click on the button &quot;New Appointment&quot;, which forwards the agent to the calendar
            overview screen and opens a new appointment dialog.
        </para>
        <para>

            </mediaobject>
        </para>
        <para>
            Since the appointment information is simplified and needs to be compact in order to be displayed properly in the small widget, it's possible to show more
            detailed information about every value in the related tooltip while hovering over the column, as visible in the previous screenshot.
        </para>
        <para>
            Basically just the color of the related calendar, the start time of the appointment and the appointment title will be displayed to the agent.
            On hovering over the related column, further information will be displayed if needed. If the agent clicks on such an appointment, the browser
            redirects to the calendar overview screen and opens the related appointment to show the full set of information.
