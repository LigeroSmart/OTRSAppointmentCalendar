    <section>
        <title>Management of multiple calendars</title>
        <para>
            Via a management interface it is possible to add and edit calendars.
        </para>
        <para>
            Beside calendar names, it is possible to assign colors and access groups, as well as the current validity of the calendars.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Exports and imports</title>
        <para>
            Once different calendars are created, it is possible to export either the complete calendar definition (including the calendar appointments)
            in the well-known YAML-Format or just export the related appointments of a calendar to ICS-Format.
        </para>
        <para>
            It is also possible to import complete calendar structures using previously exported YAML files to restore calendar definitions or import
            just calendar appointments to an existing calendar using ICS file uploads.
        </para>
        <para>
            That offers the possibility to backup and restore single calendars or transfer them to a different OTRS installation or an external calendar tool.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Management of calendar appointments</title>
        <para>
            If at least one calendar is created and accessible by a certain agent, new or already existing appointments can be managed via a calendar overview and
            an agenda overview.
        </para>
        <para>
            Within the calendar overview, an agent is able to display, create, edit and/or delete appointments of different calendars, depending on his permission
            to the related calendars. Such appointments can be created or edited via drag and drop within this screen.
        </para>
        <para>
            The visibility of single calendars can be enabled or disabled through a calendar list within the screen.
        </para>
        <para>
            To have a good overview of available appointments within different calendars and the related dates they start or end, it is possible to select different
            view modes, like weekly view, monthly view, different timeline related views etc.
        </para>
        <para>
            Within the agenda overview, an agent is able to display the appointments of all available (accessible) calendars in a table like overview. This overview
            is designed to have a detailed overview of upcoming appointments in a structured table. Like in the calendar overview appointments can be created, edited
            or deleted. This view supports a monthly, weekly and daily point of view on available appointments.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Repeating appointments</title>
        <para>
            If recurring appointments needs to be archived, it is possible to setup detailed information about the recurrences of a single appointment.
        </para>
        <para>
            Beside pre-defined frequencies like daily, weekly, monthly etc. it is possible to setup custom repeats and exclude weekdays or dates of months,
            define the amount of recurrences and/or the end date after the appointment stops to repeat.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Notifications</title>
        <para>
            Within the edit screen of an appointment, it is possible to setup a date to notify about the appointment.
        </para>
        <para>
            As in the settings for appointment repeat, it is possible to use pre-defined templates for notifications (i.e. 5 minutes before, 15 minutes before etc.)
            or setup a custom point of time.
        </para>
        <para>
            The custom settings for notifications allows to setup a relative point of time (like 5 minutes after the appointment has been started.) or an explicit
            datetime expression.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section>

        </para>
        <para>
            It's also possible to create a new appointment out of the ticket zoom, which links the related ticket automatically to the new appointment.
        </para>

        <title>Management of multiple calendars</title>
        <para>
            Via a management interface it is possible to add and edit calendars.

            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%" fileref="images/CalendarManage-Overview.png" format="PNG"/>
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
        </para>
        <para>
            If a new calendar needs to be created or edited, it's necessary to define a calendar name a color and the permission group, the calendar
            belongs to. This is needed for agents to access the calendar properly with the related permissions.

            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%" fileref="images/CalendarManage-CalendarEdit.png" format="PNG"/>
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>

            The color can be selected with the built-in colorpicker, like in the following screenshot. There are three ways to select a color with the
            colorpicker. After clicking on the preselected color, a windows opens with a set of pre-defined colors ready to be used. If your preferred
            color is not available, you can click on the button "More", to open the advanced mode.

            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%" fileref="images/CalendarManage-CalendarEdit-Colorpicker.png" format="PNG"/>
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>

            Within that mode, you can either select a certain color by using the color bar and the color field with your mouse or you're able to directly
            use a hexcode of a desired color. By clicking on the button "Less", you can shrink the colorpicker back again to the standard mode.
            Right after a click on the button "Confirm", the new color is selected and visible in the preview field. Even if you selected a certain color
            within the advanced, the previous color will be selected again (and visible in the preview field), if you click on the "Cancel" button, but this
            just works, if you didn't confirmed your selection yet. If that's the case (but you did not save the calender yet), you may just reload your
            screen and see you current color setting again.
        </para>
        <para>
            For the selected permission group of your calendar, an agent who should have access to, needs at least a read-permission within the related group.
            Enclosed a list of permissions to access certain feature-levels within the different calendars:

            <itemizedlist mark="round">

            </itemizedlist>
        </para>
        <para>
            The validity field indicates, if a calendar is valid. Invalid calendars won't show up in the different views, even if agents have access to it.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Exporting calendars and/or appointments</title>
        <para>
            Once different calendars are created, it's possible to export either the complete calendar definition (including the calendar appointments)
            in the well-known YAML-Format or just export the related appointments of a calendar to ICS-Format.
        </para>
        <para>
            To export a complete calendar structure to the YAML-Format, the calendar list in the calendar management screen can be used.
            By clicking on the related link within column "Export", a YAML structure named "Export_Calendar_CalendarName.yml", including the calendar meta-data
            (calendar name, color, permission group, validity state) can be downloaded. The structure also includes all calendar appointments. This functionality
            can be used to simply backup a certain calendar and/or transfer it to a foreign OTRS instance.
        </para>
        <para>
            To export just the calendar appointments in ICS-Format, the link within column "Download" can be used. After clicking on the related link, an ICS-File
            named "CalendarName.ics" can be downloaded, including all appointments of the related calendar. This file can be used to backup just the appointments
            of a certain calendar and/or transfer it to either an existing calendar on a foreign OTRS instance or any other calendar tool, which supports the
            ICS-Standard, to display the appointments.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Importing calendars and/or appointments</title>
        <para>
            As an equivalent to the export function, it is possible to either import a complete calendar structure including related appointments in the YAML-Format,
            or just a set of appointments to an already existing calendar in the ICS-Format.
        </para>
        <para>
            To import a complete calendar structure, the related widget "Calendar Import" on the left side of the calendar management screen can be used. Within this
            widget, a YML-File can be selected and uploaded to import the calendar. The checkbox "Overwrite existing entities" indicates, if a calendar with the same
            name as the imported one, should be overwritten. If a calendar with the same name exists, but the checkbox is empty during the upload, a related error
            message will be displayed.
        </para>
        <para>
            To import a set of appointments to an already existing calendar, the button "Import Appointments" can be clicked to access the appointment import screen.

            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%" fileref="images/CalendarManage-AppointmentImport.png" format="PNG"/>
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>

            Here it's needed to select an ICS-File to be used for the import. Right after that, a calender needs to be selected from the related list, to import the
            new appointments in. The checkbox "Update existing appointments" indicates, if already existing appointments with the same title shall be overwritten
            or not. Appointments with the same title but already existing in the related calender won't be ommited during the import process. They will be inserted
            again and will be available multiple times in case of doubt, if the option to overwrite appointments is not enabled.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>CalendarOverview</title>
        <para>
            If at least one calendar is created and accessible by a certain agent, new or already existing appointments can be managed via a calendar overview and
            an an agenda overview.
        </para>
        <para>
            Within the calendar overview, an agent is able to display, create, edit and/or delete appointments of different calendars, depending on his permission
            to the related calendars, as described above.

            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%" fileref="images/CalendarOverview.png" format="PNG"/>
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
        </para>
        <para>
            As visible in the following screenshot, the calendar overview contains the management tools for the calendars and appointments on the left side and the
            calendar view on the right side.
            With the buttons in the Actions-Widget, it's possible to either access the calendar management directly or add a new appointment (if the agent has the
            permission.)

            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%" fileref="images/CalendarOverview-Sidebar.png" format="PNG"/>
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>

            The widget "Calendars" contains all calendars accessible by the agent. The checkboxes are used to enable or disable the view of certain calendars, like
            it's the case in many foreign calendar tools.

            Since all appointments of any active calendar for every agent will be provided by the server (and not stored or cached on the client), it can result in
            heavy load on the server, if too many calendars are active at the same time. Therefore a SysConfig option "AppointmentCalendar::CalendarLimitOverview"
            limits the maximum number of active calendars per agent. If the limit is reached by an agent, a related error message will be displayed, indicating the
            there are too many active calendars.

            The URL column provides an external link to the calendar, which is used to subscribe. This functionality is described later in this document.
        </para>
        <para>
            To have a good overview of available appointments within different calendars and the related dates the appointments start or end, we provide different
            view modes to be used by the agents.

            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%" fileref="images/CalendarOverview-ViewModes.png" format="PNG"/>
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>

            They are seperated in timeline modes and non-timeline modes with different time ranges, to have the best view on different appointments for the related
            situations. On most of the view modes, a red line indicates the current time of the current day.
            The information in the middle of the top-bar shows the current time range the agent is in, for the current view. Within the timeline views, the current
            calendar week will be displayed in light grey, when possible. Within the non-timeline views, the current calendar week is displayed as a single column
            on the left side, if possible.

            Enclosed a screenshot of the non-timeline weekly view:

            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%" fileref="images/CalendarOverview-Week.png" format="PNG"/>
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>

            and the non-timeline monthly view:

            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%" fileref="images/CalendarOverview-Month.png" format="PNG"/>
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
        </para>
        <para>
            On the upper right side, the agents can access the navigation controls.

            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%" fileref="images/CalendarOverview-Navigations.png" format="PNG"/>
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>

            The left- and right-arrow buttons are used to navigate through the dates of the current time range. The button "Today" brings the agent back to the
            current date to save time.

            The button "Jump" is used to access a certain date directly without a need to go every date in between to access a certain date (maybe one year earlier
            or later). A click on the button opens a datepicker, which highlights all dates, which have already appointments stored. A mouseover shows the number of
            appointments added to the current date. A click on a date brings the agent to the related timerange and displays all appointments.

             <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%" fileref="images/CalendarOverview-Navigations-Jump.png" format="PNG"/>
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
        </para>
        <para>
            On the right side of the main widget (on top of the navigation buttons), a gear wheel appears on mouse over, which is used to access a visibility filter:

            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%" fileref="images/CalendarOverview-Preferences.png" format="PNG"/>
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>

            Here you can choose, if you want to see all available appointments, or just the ones, that are directly assigned to you.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>AgendaOverview</title>
        <para>
            Within the agenda overview, an agent is able to display the appointments of all available (accessible) calendars in a table like overview. This overview
            is designed to have a detailed overview of upcoming appointments in a structured table. Like in the calendar overview appointments can be created, edited
            or deleted. This view supports a monthly, weekly and daily point of view on available appointments.

            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%" fileref="images/AgendaOverview.png" format="PNG"/>
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
        </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Management of calendar appointments</title>
        <para>
            Within the calendar overview, to add new appointments, it's either possible to click on the button "Add Appointment" or click on the overview widget.
            It's also possible to drag over a range of the widget to setup a time span roughly. Right after that, a modal dialog appears where the data can be
            inserted:

            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%" fileref="images/CalendarOverview-AppointmentEdit.png" format="PNG"/>
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>

            The only mandatory fields of the basic information are the appointment title and the related calendar to assign the appointment to. The description
            and location are optional fields. If the location contains a value, a related link icon will show up next to the field which by default links to
            google maps to get a better picture of the location. This link is configurable through the SysConfig option 'AgentAppointmentEdit::Location::Link'.
        </para>
        <para>
            Within the Date/Time section, the related start date and end date needs to be selected.
            The "All-day" checkbox indicates, that the appointment takes place on the whole day. If it's activated, time of the start date and the end date, will
            be disabled and set to 00:00.
            The repeat option is used to define appointment recurrences and will be described seperately, see section "Repeating appointments" below.
        </para>
        <para>
            The notification option is used to define appointment notifications and will be described seperately, see section "Notifications" below.
        </para>
        <para>
            The link option is used to define appointment links to foreign objects (like tickets) and will be described seperately, see section
            "Link tickets to appointments" below.
        </para>
        <para>
            If the appointment already exists and will be added currently, the buttons "Copy" and "Delete" appear at the bottom of the modal dialog, if the current
            agent has the related permissions. The button "Copy" will just ignore the changes in the dialog and create a copy of the current appointment at the same
            timerange with equal information stored. The button "Delete" will delete related appointment, but the agent will face a question, if he's really sure to
            delete the appointment, for security reasons.
        </para>
        <para>
            Once the appointment has been saved, it appears in the overview of the page:

            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%" fileref="images/CalendarOverview-AppointmentAdded.png" format="PNG"/>
                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>

            With a click on the appointment, the modal dialog opens again and can be edited. If the agent has the correct permission, the appointment can also be
            edited via drag and drop to either move the complete appointment to another place (date/time) or just increase/decrease the start- and/or the end-time
            by dragging the appointment on the related handles on the left end or the right end.
        </para>
        <para>
            If the cursor of the mouse hovers over a certain appointment, a tooltip with the related appointment information appears to show up detailed information:

            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%" fileref="images/CalendarOverview-AppointmentMouseOver.png" format="PNG"/>

    <section>
        <title>Repeating appointments</title>
        <para>
            If recurring appointments needs to be archived, it is possible to setup detailed information about the recurrences of a single appointment.
        </para>
        <para>
            Beside pre-defined frequencies like daily, weekly, monthly etc. it is possible to setup custom repeats and exclude weekdays or dates of months,
            define the amount of recurrences and/or the end date after the appointment stops to repeat.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Notifications</title>
        <para>
            Within the edit screen of an appointment, it is possible to setup a date to notify about the appointment.
        </para>
        <para>
            As in the settings for appointment repeat, it is possible to use pre-defined templates for notifications (i.e. 5 minutes before, 15 minutes before etc.)
            or setup a custom point of time.
        </para>
        <para>
            The custom settings for notifications allows to setup a relative point of time (like 5 minutes after the appointment has been started.) or an explicit
            datetime expression.
        </para>

    <section>
        <title>Link tickets to appointments</title>

            Links between tickets and appointments appear in the TicketZoom like every other linked objects in a related table.
        </para>
        <para>
            Those links can either be created through an existing appointment, using the overviews or via the link feature in the ticket zoom.
        </para>
        <para>
            It's also possible to create a new appointment out of the ticket zoom, which links the related ticket automatically to the new appointment.
